## Font Optimization Implementation

The following changes have been made to optimize font loading and prevent flickering:

1. Updated font configuration in `layout.tsx`:
   - Added `display: 'swap'` to show fallback font while loading
   - Enabled `preload: true` to prioritize font loading
   - Using subsets for Latin characters to reduce font file size

2. Enhanced Next.js configuration in `next.config.mjs`:
   - Enabled `optimizeFonts: true` at root level
   - Added experimental font optimization

These changes should resolve the font flickering issue by:
- Preloading the font files
- Using font-display: swap to show fallback font during loading
- Optimizing font loading through Next.js built-in optimizations
- Reducing the font file size by using specific subsets

The WOFF file should now load earlier in the page load sequence, preventing the text flickering effect.
